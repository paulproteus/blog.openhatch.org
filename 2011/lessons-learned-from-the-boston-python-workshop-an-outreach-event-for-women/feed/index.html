We also get a lot of scientists who want to learn to program to help with their data analysis, and some entrepreneurs who are coming with an eye towards making websites and apps to support their brand.

We also get students, DBAs, artists, web developers, librarians, sysadmins, people who have friends or family who program and want to see what all the hubbub is about... It&#039;s a great mix of people.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent summary, Jessica --- thanks very much for putting it together.  What sort of age distribution do you see in attendees?  Mostly under-30s looking for a career change, do you get a significant number of women who are re-entering the workforce after time away, etc.?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jessica, this is one great write-up. (I also really love the citations at the end!)

I think that one of the best things that the workshop has done for the world is prepare solid, cross-platform Python+editor install instructions. I&#039;m referring to the new check-list that the round 2 crowd did while I was out of town. It&#039;s superb.

It&#039;s been really fun to see something I helped start grow into something with so much enthusiasm behind it. I hope that as people see your post, they realize that they can run something similar!]]></description>
