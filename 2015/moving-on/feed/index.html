You have left a big impact during your time as Program Director: growing OpenHatch&#039;s reach at campuses, developing open source documentation and guides for running events, creating a WelcomeBot to welcome new individuals to IRC, and so much more. You&#039;ve shared your talents with warmth and grace. Thank you and good luck in your new adventures. I&#039;m so glad that you will continue to share your love of OpenHatch and its mission.]]></description>
