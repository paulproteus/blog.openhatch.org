		<description><![CDATA[As a professional software developer working as a contractor, showing my skills is very important.

Ohloh concentrates on code committed by yourself. This works for projects on which you are deeply involved (core committer), but not on projects on which you are an occasional contributor and where you contribute bug reports and patches.

Also it would be interesting to be informed about events (hackatons, conferences) in my area.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A personal planet feed would be pretty neat.  I mean, in a sense I am already doing that, setting up rss feeds on my computer from a selection of people I am interested in.  What would be more interesting than just &quot;picking&quot; a list of people I am interested in is picking a list *for me* based on a set of say, tagged interests: I&#039;m interested in python &#038; blender, but maybe I don&#039;t know about everyone in the python and blender world.  So informing me of such people would be cool.]]></description>
