		<description><![CDATA[I was really amused to see &quot;Bugs Matching Unicode (30)&quot; on the top of the list when checking out Openhatch, considering that anything to do with Unicode is on my &#039;oh dear god no, not me ... please don&#039;t assign that to me .... &#039; list.

The other thing I avoid is anything to do with lexical parsers. I _can_ make them, I just find the entire process scary, taxing and always worry that I&#039;m doing it completely wrong. I&#039;m not really worried about what other people think of my first few attempts, I just worry that I can keep them to &#039;just a few&#039; before getting it right :)

I will say this, every developer&#039;s worst nightmare is seeing a patch they wrote featured on Slashdot as the cause of thousands of systems being compromised. As a maintainer, you have to be able to say &quot;I have no #*&#038;#(*&#038; clue what that code actually does, I&#039;m not touching it until I do.&quot; That sometimes applies to code that you wrote yourself :)

For the most part, however, peer review is often helpful and constructive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Please come across to Reddit. Your openhatch project was mentioned there, but any requests for help/ideas are met with mumble-mumble-apathy.

By the way, I dread packaging (even for Debian). I just can&#039;t seem to get my head around it!]]></description>
