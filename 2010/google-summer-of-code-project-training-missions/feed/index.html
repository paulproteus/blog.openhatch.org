		<description><![CDATA[Great work!!! Completely blown off by the concept.

I have used FOSS for quite some time, I were really hoping to contribute to it. But, i was not getting the path about how to do it. But, a big thanks to you guys for the awesome training module that you have provided, it indeed was the thing that i was hoping would start my career as open source developer.

Thank You, very much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[** I love the missions!  **

** I think they are awesome!  **

*** More missions would be extra awesome! ***

Now, one minor pick: would it be possible to replace he/him by they/them in the above post.  You might not notice, but women like me do feel alienated when the masculine pronoun is used.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sarah! I&#039;m Asheesh, working with John on the missions.

Yeah, I would be really excited if people could contribute new (project-specific) missions. I think we will eventually move toward making that easier!

You can already contribute missions along the lines of what we&#039;re doing by cloning our source code and playing around.

If you want to keep chatting, the best way is to join our chat room as described at our &quot;Contact us&quot; page, #openhatch on FreeNode.]]></description>
