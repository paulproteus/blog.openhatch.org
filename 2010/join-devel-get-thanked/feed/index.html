		<description><![CDATA[Got the video from ftp://ftp-osl.osuosl.org/pub/teachingopensource/edsummit7-asheesh-laroia.ogg

I&#039;m interested in helping openhatch succeed, because I believe the FLOSS universe fails to use the human resources available as efficiently as possible. I hope the website can bring new developers into the fold and help small projects find people who want to help.

I&#039;ll need help from the devel list to find my way around an unfamiliar codebase, in particular one written in a language I don&#039;t particularly use. To familiarize myself with the development process and community, I&#039;ll aim to add support for gravatars (in production, probably reverse-proxied for privacy reasons and cached for performance reasons).]]></description>
