		<description><![CDATA[Awesome -- we will keep the blog up-to-date!

We&#039;re dreaming that one day, we&#039;ll generate the buildhelper UI straight from a text file with a special format. That way, you can keep it in a wiki, or a code repository, and we can refresh once a day with the latest updates.

(And for people who want to edit them on the web within the OpenHatch site, sure, we should support that too.)

I&#039;m really excited about the &quot;Click to get help&quot; thing -- it&#039;s yet another way we can lure people into IRC who really should be there, but don&#039;t know how useful a resource it is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This sounds like a good idea to me! I end up writing a lot of howto documentation that assumes a fresh server, because that is what I am dealing with. A lot of the beginning steps are the same, and I&#039;ve been think of modularizing them. I think a template system is the logical conclusion.

I like your format ideas, I hadn&#039;t thought of stating how long each step should take. And being able to stop and come back is great.

Please update here with how this develops. I want to provide feedback and incorporate your template into my documentation. ^_^]]></description>
